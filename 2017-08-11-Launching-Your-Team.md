# Launching Your Team

An email will be sent to you when your team is ready to be launched. Click the link "Launch Team" to be taken to the site. You will be asked to log in or to create a new account. Next, you will be given the option of continuing into the team setup process, or delegating the responsibility to a colleague.

## Team Setup

The next step of the launch process is to complete the setup page for your team. This page will prompt you to invite a team captain, team coaches, request an IT Test, adjust your autogroup settings, and schedule a training session for your organization. You can complete as many sections as you can, and leave any fields blank until you are ready to fill it out. All admin coaches who join the team will be shown the same team setup page and offered the option of completing the sections until the page is completely filled out.

## Your PD Path

Once you have joined the team successfully, your last step in the Team Setup will be to begin working on your PD Path. This path is very similar to the path that students will be working on, only it contains information for coaches.

## Additional Steps

After coaches complete their first activity in the path, there are a few other areas they should check out before they begin adding students:

* **Groups** - Double check the groups in the list, follow any groups that you will want to monitor, and create any additional groups that you will need

* **Metrics **- Familiarize yourself with the filters, and use the metrics page to respond to other coaches' comments in the path.

* **Team Library** - Check out the files inside the team's library.
